# Introduction
This folder contains a solution and testing files namely, `maxflow.py` and  `*.in`.
The solution is for the kattis problem called Maximum Flow which is a problem where we have to find the maximum flow and the edges used.
Test file `4.in` is not from the kattis problem but from the book that we are using in the course.
